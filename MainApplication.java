     * Public non-static method used to create the first level for the actual game.
     * <p>
     * This public non-static method will be used to create the first level of the
     * program and return it as a scene. It will do this by creating 4 instances of the
     * Grid.java class to simulate the grid and it also has an action listener
     * for moving, and interaction with books. It draws this on a scene that it
     * returns with the draw method in the Grid instance and a photo at the location
     * of the mainX and mainY coordinates of the Grid instance.
     * <p>
     * Done by: Simon
     * Simon Bakan May 23-27 spent 5 hours: completely re-did grid instantiation,
     * added books, added interaction with books, added label for number of books
     * collected, and added multiple grids.

     *              stage that the program will use and display to the user.
